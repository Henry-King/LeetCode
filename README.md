# Abstract
This is a public project for my solution of LeetCode question

# Commit Log Format
The commit log should contain type of algorithm(like naive apparch, DP or etc.). Time complexity or question can also be attached if you feel it is necessary, e.g.

    Naive approach
    O(N)
    This is a stupid question with magic number.
